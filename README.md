# Activity3
Accessing an activity from third-party apps installed in the user's O.S. and performing the action of opening a web page.
<br><br>
Implicit Intent: It doesn't specify the class that I want to open, but specify an action I want to do.<br>
<br>
For each type of action I have a specific parameter that I send to create an intent relationed what I want to do, example: access camera, access calendar, access alarm, access a contact list, etc...<br>
In this app I used the action Intent.ACTION_VIEW to open a web page.<br>
<br>
This example was used to learn and practice programming techniques in Android Studio in my postgraduate course at UTFPR(Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná).<br>
